# AmigaKeyboard
Replacement keyboard supporting MX-compatible switches, for all Amigas except A600 and A1200.

This keyboard design is based around an ATMega32U4 as keyboard controller, and is intended to be used as a replacement keyboards for Amigas with a keyboard controller on the keyboard.  This includes the A500, A1000, A2000, A3000 and A4000, including variants and towers.

The A600 and A1200 have the keyboard controller on the motherboard, and are not compatible with this keyboard design.

There are further notes in the Firmware and PCB folders, relevant to those parts of the project.

It should be noted that this is an early design, but I have built a keyboard up from scratch with this PCB and firmware and it is working on my A4000.
