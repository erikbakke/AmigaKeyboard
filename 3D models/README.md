# 3D models

This folder contains 3D models associated with the Amiga replacement keyboard project


| Model | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Amiga MX key stem adapter | Quick hack to allow putting original Amiga key caps on top of MX-compatible switches.  The keys are raised by about 7mm compared to a directly mounted key cap, so it may interfere with a keyboard case. |
